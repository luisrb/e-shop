# E-Shop

This project is an online shop that allows users to browse a catalogue of products and view detailed information about each product. In addition, users can add products to their shopping cart.

The shop has been developed using **React** and makes use of **Axios** to make API calls. An Axios interceptor called ``axios-cache-interceptor`` has been implemented which allows queries to be cached in the browser's local storage. This improves the performance of the application and reduces the load on the server.
